# Clean Code - Chapter 8 Summary: Boundaries

## Introduction
In software development, we often integrate third-party code or components from other teams. This chapter explores practices to maintain clean boundaries between our code and external code.

## Using Third-Party Code
- **Tension at Boundaries**: Third-party interfaces aim for broad applicability, while users need specific functionality. This can create issues at system boundaries.
- **Example with `Map`**: Using `java.util.Map` can lead to excessive capabilities and potential misuse. Encapsulating `Map` within a class like `Sensors` can hide unnecessary details and enforce design rules.

## Exploring and Learning Boundaries
- **Learning Tests**: Writing tests to explore third-party APIs helps understand their behavior without integrating them directly into production code. These tests, called learning tests, verify that the API works as expected and provide a safety net for future updates.

## Using Code That Does Not Yet Exist
- **Defining Interfaces**: When dealing with undefined or unknown components, define your own interfaces to maintain control and clarity. This approach allows for clean and expressive client code and facilitates adaptation once the external API is available.

## Clean Boundaries
- **Managing Change**: Good design accommodates change with minimal rework. Code at boundaries should be well-separated and tested to define expectations.
- **Control and Adaptation**: Prefer controlling interfaces over relying on third-party specifics. Use wrappers or adapters to maintain a consistent internal interface, reducing maintenance when external code changes.

## Conclusion
Maintaining clean boundaries in software design helps manage change and integration with third-party code. By encapsulating external interfaces and using learning tests, we can ensure our code remains robust and maintainable.
