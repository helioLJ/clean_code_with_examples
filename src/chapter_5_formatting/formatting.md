# Clean Code - Chapter 5 Summary: Formatting

## Formatting

### Importance of Formatting
- **Professional Appearance**: Well-formatted code reflects professionalism and attention to detail. It should impress others with its neatness and orderliness.
- **Consistency**: Consistent formatting is crucial for readability and maintainability. Teams should agree on a single set of formatting rules.

### Purpose of Formatting
- **Communication**: Formatting is about communication, not just aesthetics. It helps convey the structure and intent of the code.

### Vertical Formatting
- **File Size**: Smaller files (around 200-500 lines) are generally easier to understand.
- **Newspaper Metaphor**: Code should be structured like a newspaper article, with high-level concepts at the top and details at the bottom.
- **Vertical Openness**: Use blank lines to separate different concepts and improve readability.
- **Vertical Density**: Related lines of code should be close together to show their association.
- **Vertical Distance**: Keep related concepts close to avoid unnecessary scrolling and searching.

### Horizontal Formatting
- **Line Length**: Aim for shorter lines, ideally under 80-120 characters, to avoid horizontal scrolling.
- **Horizontal Openness and Density**: Use spaces to separate distinct elements and group related ones.
- **Horizontal Alignment**: Avoid aligning code horizontally as it can distract from the code's intent.

### Indentation
- **Hierarchy Visibility**: Indentation reflects the hierarchy of scopes, making the structure of the code clear.
- **Breaking Indentation**: Avoid collapsing scopes into single lines; maintain proper indentation for clarity.

### Team Rules
- **Consistency Across Team**: Teams should agree on a common formatting style to ensure consistency across the codebase.
