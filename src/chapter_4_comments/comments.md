# Clean Code - Chapter 4 Summary: Comments

## Comments

### The Nature of Comments
- **Comments as a Necessary Evil**: Comments are often seen as a necessary evil, used to compensate for the failure to express intent in code. Ideally, code should be self-explanatory.
- **The Problem with Comments**: Comments can become outdated and misleading as code evolves. They often lie unintentionally, leading to confusion.

### When to Use Comments
- **Good Comments**: Some comments are beneficial, such as legal comments, informative comments, explanations of intent, clarifications, warnings of consequences, and TODOs.
- **Legal Comments**: Required for legal reasons, such as copyright notices.
- **Informative Comments**: Provide useful information, like explaining a return value.
- **Explanation of Intent**: Explain the rationale behind a decision.
- **Clarification**: Translate obscure arguments or return values into something readable.
- **Warning of Consequences**: Warn about potential issues or consequences.
- **TODO Comments**: Indicate tasks that need to be completed later.

### Avoiding Bad Comments
- **Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code**: Instead of commenting on bad code, refactor it to be clear and expressive.
- **Redundant Comments**: Avoid comments that restate the obvious or are less precise than the code.
- **Misleading Comments**: Ensure comments are accurate and do not mislead.
- **Mandated Comments**: Avoid rules that require comments for every function or variable, as they often lead to clutter.
- **Journal Comments**: Avoid maintaining a log of changes in comments; use version control systems instead.
- **Noise Comments**: Avoid comments that provide no new information or are redundant.

### Alternatives to Comments
- **Explain Yourself in Code**: Use descriptive function and variable names to make the code self-explanatory.
- **Function Headers**: Short functions with well-chosen names often do not need comments.
- **Javadocs in Nonpublic Code**: Avoid using Javadocs for internal code, as they can become clutter.

### Conclusion
- **Minimize Comments**: Strive to write clear and expressive code that minimizes the need for comments. When comments are necessary, ensure they are accurate and add value.
