# Clean Code - Chapter 11 Summary: Systems

## Building a City Analogy
- **City Management**: Cities function through teams managing different systems (water, power, etc.) with appropriate abstraction and modularity.
- **Software Systems**: Often lack the same separation of concerns and abstraction levels, which clean code can help achieve at the system level.

## Separate Construction from Use
- **Construction vs. Use**: Software systems should separate the startup process (object construction and dependency wiring) from runtime logic.
- **Lazy Initialization**: While useful, it can lead to hard-coded dependencies and testing difficulties, breaking the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Separation of Main
- **Main Function**: Move construction to `main` or modules called by `main`, ensuring the application assumes all objects are constructed and wired.

## Factories
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Allows applications to control object creation while keeping construction details separate.

## Dependency Injection (DI)
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: Moves responsibility for instantiating dependencies to a separate mechanism, supporting SRP.
- **DI Containers**: Use configuration files or modules to specify dependencies, allowing for flexible and testable systems.

## Scaling Up
- **Incremental Growth**: Software systems can grow incrementally, unlike physical systems, if concerns are properly separated.
- **EJB Example**: Early EJB architectures failed to separate concerns, leading to tight coupling and testing difficulties.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Restores modularity for concerns like persistence and security, which cut across object boundaries.

## Java Proxies and AOP Frameworks
- **Java Proxies**: Suitable for simple situations but complex for clean code.
- **Spring and JBoss AOP**: Use proxies internally to implement aspects, allowing POJOs to focus on domain logic.

## Test Drive the System Architecture
- **POJOs and Aspects**: Enable test-driven architecture, allowing systems to evolve from simple to sophisticated without Big Design Up Front (BDUF).

## Optimize Decision Making
- **Decentralized Management**: Modularity allows for decentralized decision-making and postponing decisions until the last moment for optimal choices.

## Use Standards Wisely
- **Standards**: Useful for reuse and encapsulating good ideas, but should not overshadow delivering customer value.

## Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)
- **DSLs**: Minimize the communication gap between domain concepts and code, raising abstraction levels and revealing code intent.

## Conclusion
- **Clean Systems**: Must maintain clear intent at all abstraction levels, using POJOs and aspect-like mechanisms to incorporate concerns noninvasively.
- **Simplicity**: Always aim for the simplest solution that works.
