# Clean Code - Chapter 2 Summary: Meaningful Names

## Introduction
- Naming is a crucial part of programming, as names are used for variables, functions, classes, and more.
- Good naming practices improve code readability and maintainability.

## Use Intention-Revealing Names
- Names should clearly convey the purpose and usage of the variable or function.
- Avoid names that require additional comments to explain their purpose.

## Avoid Disinformation
- Avoid names that could mislead or confuse, such as using terms with entrenched meanings in different contexts.
- Ensure names accurately reflect the data structures they represent.

## Make Meaningful Distinctions
- Avoid using arbitrary distinctions like number series or noise words that don't add meaning.
- Names should reflect their unique purpose and context.

## Use Pronounceable Names
- Names should be easy to pronounce to facilitate discussion and collaboration among developers.

## Use Searchable Names
- Avoid single-letter names and numeric constants that are difficult to search for in the codebase.
- Longer, descriptive names are preferable for searchability.

## Avoid Encodings
- Avoid encoding type or scope information into names, as it adds unnecessary complexity.
- Modern programming environments and languages make such encodings obsolete.

## Avoid Mental Mapping
- Names should not require readers to mentally translate them into more familiar terms.
- Use clear, descriptive names that reflect their purpose directly.

## Class and Method Names
- Class names should be nouns or noun phrases, while method names should be verbs or verb phrases.
- Consistency in naming conventions helps maintain clarity.

## Don’t Be Cute
- Avoid clever or humorous names that may not be understood by all developers.
- Clarity should be prioritized over entertainment.

## Pick One Word per Concept
- Use consistent terminology for similar concepts across the codebase to avoid confusion.

## Avoid Puns
- Avoid using the same word for different purposes, as it can lead to misunderstandings.

## Use Solution Domain Names
- Use technical terms and concepts familiar to programmers when appropriate.

## Use Problem Domain Names
- When no technical term exists, use names from the problem domain to provide context.

## Add Meaningful Context
- Provide context for names through well-named classes, functions, or namespaces.
- Avoid unnecessary prefixes or suffixes that add clutter.

## Don’t Add Gratuitous Context
- Avoid adding unnecessary context to names, which can make them longer and harder to read.

## Final Words
- Good naming requires descriptive skills and a shared understanding among developers.
- Don't be afraid to rename for clarity, as it improves code readability and maintainability.
